al.abcd2,AL,"Owners and operators of petroleum UST systems must provide release detection for underground storage tanks and underground piping as follows:
(a) USTs. USTs installed beginning on August 6, 2007 and thereafter, must perform interstitial monitoring at least every 30 days in accordance with rule 335-6-15-.17(g). USTs installed prior to August 6, 2007 must be monitored for releases at least every 30 days using one of the methods listed in rule 335-6- 15-.17(d) through (i), except that:
15-40
1. Underground storage tanks with nominal capacity of 550 gallons or less, and tanks with a nominal capacity of 551 to 1,000 gallons that meet the underground storage tank diameter criteria in rule 335-6-15-.17(b), may use weekly manual tank gauging conducted in accordance with rule 335-6-15-.17(b).
(b) Underground Piping. Underground piping that routinely contains regulated substances must be monitored for releases in a manner that meets one of the following requirements:
1. Pressurized Underground Piping. Underground piping that conveys regulated substances under pressure must:
(i) Be equipped with an automatic line leak detector conducted in accordance with rule 335-6-15-.18(a); and
(ii) Pressurized underground piping installed beginning on August 6, 2007 and thereafter, must perform interstitial monitoring at least every 30 days in accordance with rule 335-6-15-.18(c) and as described in rule 335-6-15-.17(g). Pressurized underground piping installed before August 6, 2007 must have an annual line tightness test conducted in accordance with rule 335-6-15-.18(b) or have monitoring conducted at least every 30 days in accordance with rule 335- 6-15-.18(c).
2. Suction Underground Piping. Underground piping that conveys regulated substances under suction installed on or after April 25, 2008 must perform interstitial monitoring at least every 30 days in accordance with rule 335-6-15-.18(c) and as described in rule 335-6-15-.17(g). Underground piping that conveys regulated substances under suction installed before April 25, 2008 must either have a line tightness test conducted at least every 3 years and in accordance with rule 335-6-15-.18(b), or use a monitoring method conducted at least every 30 days in accordance with rule 335-6-15-.18(c). No release detection is required for suction underground piping that is designed and constructed to meet the following standards:
(i) The suction underground piping operates at less than atmospheric pressure;
(ii) The suction underground piping is sloped so that the contents of the underground pipe will drain back into the underground storage tank if the suction is released;
(iii) Only one check valve is included in each suction line;
(iv) The check valve is located directly below and as close as practical
to the suction pump; and
(v) A method is provided that allows compliance with subparagraphs (b)2.(ii) through (iv) above, to be readily determined.

(c) Any petroleum UST systems installed prior to August 6, 2007 which are: located within 1000 feet of a public water supply well; located within 300 feet of a private domestic water supply; or which are located in an area which the Department has determined to be exceptionally vulnerable to groundwater contamination, may be required to take additional measures to prevent contamination of groundwater. Such measures may include the installation of additional release detection methods in accordance with one of the methods in rule 335-6-15-.17(d) through (i) for underground storage tanks and (e) through (h) for underground piping and/or the implementation of more frequent monitoring of release detection systems.",335-6-15-.15,This AL reg matches with 280.5.15,no local regs in AL,obtain release detection like this: example example example,hyperlink example,Release Detection Requirments,"release detection, piping, sump, udc, sensor, safe suction, stp, double wall, csld, line leak, leak test,sir,",,,
