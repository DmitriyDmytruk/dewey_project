suspected releases of regulated substances requiring reporting under rule 335-
6-15-.20 within 7 days and submit the results to the Department within 10 days,
or another reasonable time period specified by the Department, using either the
following steps or another procedure approved by the Department: (a) System test. Owners and operators must conduct tests (according
to the requirements for tightness testing in rules 335-6-15-.17(c) and
335-6-15-.18(b) or as appropriate, secondary containment testing described in
rule 335-6-15-.12(f)).
1. The test must determine whether:
(i) A leak exists in that portion of the underground storage tank, or the
attached underground delivery piping; or
(ii) A breach of either wall of the secondary containment has occurred.
2. If the UST system test confirms a leak into the interstice or a
release, owners and operators must immediately temporarily close the UST
system in accordance with rule 335-6-15-.33(1)(c), repair the UST system in
accordance with rule 335-6-15-.12, or permanently close the UST system in
accordance with rules 335-6-15-.34 through 335-6-15-.37. In addition, owners
and operators must begin corrective action if the test results for the system
(underground storage tank, and/or underground delivery piping) indicate that a
release exists.
3. The Department may release an owner or operator from any further
investigation requirements if the underground storage tank tests tight after minor
repairs to that portion of the underground storage tank that does not routinely
contain product.
4. Further investigation is not required if the test results for the
system (underground storage tank, and/or underground delivery piping) do not
indicate that a release exists and if environmental contamination is not the basis
for suspecting a release.
5. Owners and operators must conduct a preliminary investigation as
described in subparagraph (b) of this rule if the test results for the system
(underground storage tank, and/or underground delivery piping) do not indicate
that a release exists but environmental contamination is the basis for suspecting
a release.
(b) Preliminary investigation. Owners and operators must measure for
the presence of a release where contamination is most likely to be present at the
UST system site. In selecting sample types, sample locations, and measurement
methods, owners and operators must consider the nature of the stored
substance, the type of initial alarm or cause for suspicion, the type of backfill,
the depth of groundwater, and other factors appropriate for identifying the
presence and source of the release. Specific requirements for a preliminary
investigation are included in rule 335-6-15-.26.
1. If in the determination of the Department the results of the
preliminary investigation indicate that a release has occurred, owners and
operators must initiate corrective action in accordance with rules 335-6-15-.24 through 335-6-15-.31. The Department may require a secondary investigation
to be performed.

(f) Address measures necessary to meet local, state of Alabama or federal requirements for control of surface or air discharges or disposal of soil; and
(g) Include a proposed schedule of implementation and monitoring plan.
(3) The Department will approve the corrective action plan only when satisfied that implementation of the plan provides for measures considered adequate to protect human health, safety, and the environment. In making this determination, the Department should consider the following factors as appropriate:
(a) The physical and chemical characteristics of the regulated substance, including its toxicity, persistence, and potential for migration;
(b) The hydrogeologic characteristics of the site and the surrounding area;

(g) Any information assembled in compliance with this subpart.
(4) Upon approval of the corrective action plan or as directed by the Department, owners and operators must implement the plan, including modification to the plan made by or required to be made by the Department. They must monitor, evaluate, and report the results of implementing the plan in accordance with a schedule and in a format established by the Department.
(5) If at any time, the Department determines that the implementation of corrective actions are not achieving adequate protection of human health and the environment, the Department may require additional measures to be taken.
(6) Owners and operators shall continue implementation of the corrective action plan until released in writing from this responsibility by the Department.
(7) Owners and operators may, in the interest of minimizing environmental contamination and promoting more effective cleanup, begin cleanup of soil and groundwater before the corrective action plan is approved provided that they:
(a) Notify the Department of their intention to begin cleanup;
(b) Comply with any conditions imposed by the Department, including
halting cleanup or mitigating adverse consequences from cleanup activities; and
(c) Incorporate these self-initiated cleanup measures in the corrective action plan that is submitted to the Department for approval.
(8) Upon conclusion of investigative monitoring, or corrective actions at a site, the Department may require any or all monitoring wells to be properly closed. The following requirements shall apply when establishing risk based corrective action limits applicable to the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination resulting from releases from underground storage tanks regulated under this chapter.
(a) A risk based corrective action process will be used to establish site specific corrective action limits protective of human health and the environment. Corrective action limits, institutional controls, or a combination thereof, shall be adequate to support onsite and surrounding property use consistent with existing and reasonable future use and achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable environmental standards for air, soil and waters of the state of Alabama. The only exception to the use of a risk based corrective action process shall be that as described in rule 335-6-15-.30(f).
(b) Free product shall be removed to the maximum extent practicable.
(c) A risk based corrective action process requires the specification of
a target risk level for carcinogenic effects. The estimated individual excess lifetime cancer risk (IELCR) will be:
1. For constituents resulting from releases of petroleum or petroleum- based regulated substances, as regulated under this chapter, the estimated IELCR level used to establish site specific corrective action limits shall be 10-5, for all constituents of concern, for each exposure pathway. If corrective action to a 10-5 risk level is determined by the Department to be infeasible, and in the determination of the Department, appropriate institutional controls are implemented, the Department may approve a site-specific corrective action limit that represents a risk level equal to but not greater than 10-4; and
2. For constituents resulting from releases of non-petroleum regulated substances, as regulated under this chapter, the estimated IELCR used to establish site specific corrective action limits shall be no less than 10-6 and no greater than 10-5. If corrective action to a 10-6 to 10-5 risk level is determined by the Department to be infeasible, and in the determination of the Department, appropriate institutional controls are implemented, the Department may approve a site specific corrective action limit that represents a risk level equal to but not greater than 10-4.
(d) For non-carcinogenic substances, a hazard quotient of one will be used.
(e) For the groundwater ingestion pathway, for constituents for which a Maximum Contaminant Level, MCL, has been established, the corrective action limit shall be set equal to the MCL. For carcinogenic constituents for which a
15-66
Maximum Contaminant Level has not been established, the estimated IELCR shall be 10-6.
(f) For hydrogeologic settings, where the models used in the risk based evaluations are considered in the determination of the Department, not to be representative of, and thus not protective of, a given hydrogeologic setting, the Department may require implementation of a corrective action plan to continue until the concentration of dissolved contaminants has leveled off. Leveling off shall mean that the graph of the contaminant concentration versus time fits a curve generally defined by the equation C = Cf + Coe-kt, and the slope of the final portion of the curve approaches zero. Alternatively, the Department may approve the use of a statistical method for use in demonstrating that contaminant concentrations are no longer decreasing with continued corrective action. An indicator parameter satisfactory to the Department shall be selected for application to the curve. In the equation above, the symbols are defined as follows:
1. C - contaminant concentration at time t;
2. Cf - the final concentration which the curve approaches asymptotically;
3. Co - the concentration difference between the final concentration and the concentration at time zero;
4. e - 2.718, the base of natural logarithms;
5. k - an exponential factor which indicates how fast the concentration
approaches Cf; and
6. t - time in days from some fixed starting point.
(g) Corrective action limits, institutional controls, or a combination thereof, shall be developed and submitted for approval by the Department, using a format, procedures, and within a schedule acceptable to the Department.
